# Write a program that figures out how many times the word “the” appears in the user’s input.
#
# The program should:
#
#   - Ask the user to enter a sentence (the starter code already does this part).
#   - Receive the user’s input.
#   - Finds the number of times the word the appears in the user’s input.
#   - Print output that contains, for example:
#       'the' appeared 42 times
#       (assuming the answer was 42).

p "Enter a sentence:"
